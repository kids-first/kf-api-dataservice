    # The value was not reported, either to the original data source or to the
    # DRC, could potentially mean that follow up could occur to gather the
    # value if it's meaningful
    - Not Reported

    # In the current context the value isn't applicable
    # (e.g. tumor location for a structural birth defect
    - Not Applicable

    # The value cannot be collected due to privacy, consent, etc other issues,
    # follow up cannot occur
    - Not Allowed To Collect

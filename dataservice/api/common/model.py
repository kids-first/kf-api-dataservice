    ### Creation

    When an indexd file is created, an instance of the orm model here is
    created, and when persisted to the database, a request is sent to Gen3
    indexd to register the file in the service. Upon successful registry
    of the file, a response containing a did (digital identifier) will be
    recieved. The IndexdFile will then be inserted into the database using
    the baseid as its uuid.

    ### Update

    When a file is updated in indexd, a new version with a new did is created.
    The document still shares a base_id with the older versions, but a document
    may not be retrieved with the base_id alone. Because of this, the
    latest_did is stored on the file.

    ### Deletion

    A file deleted through a DELETE on the dataservice api will immediately
    delete that file from the dataservice's database, as well as send
    a corresponding DELETE to the indexd service.
    Though it should not occur, a file deleted through indexd will remain
    in the dataservice's database until it a retrieval is attempted.
    If indexd returns a not found error, the dataservice will automatically
    remove that file from the database, giving the appearence that the two
    are in sync from the viewpoint of the dataservice API.
